Welcome to Namelist Diff's documentation!
==========================================

Namelist Diff is a Python package that allows you to easily compare FORTRAN
namelists. It provides the command line utility ``nmldiff``, which you can use like this::

        $ nmldiff /path/to/namelist1 /path/to/namelist2

You then get a nice diff output. The quickstart on the next page provides a good overview.
